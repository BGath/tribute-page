        <h5 id="dio-events">Here are important events starring Dio in the series:</h5>
        <div id="timeline-content">
          <h6 id="part-one">Phantom Blood - The Rise of Dio Brando</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Findings of the Stone Mask</strong></li>
            <p id="stone-mask-text">As a youthful human, Dio Brando found a stone mask that possessed a mysterious presence. Upon seeing someone else put on the mask and unleash the mechanism hidden within it, he realized that the mask could become a potential strength for him in the future. He used the power of the mask on himself to transform into an immortal vampire, Dio Brando then goes on to create an army of the undead.</p>
            <li><strong>The Taking of Jonathan Joestar's Body</strong></li>
            <p id="jojo-body-text">After engaging in a grueling battle to the death with his rival and protaganist of Phantom Blood, Jonathan Joestar, Dio Brando lost his body from the neck-down. As at this point he was a strong immortal vampire, this was not enough to finish him off. Dio Brando later appeared on the boat that Joestar and Joestar's new wife was on. Fighting Joestar for the last time, Brando successfully stole his rival's body from the neck-down.</p>
            <h6 id="part-two">Stardust Crusaders - The Glorious Reign and Fall of DIO</h6>
            <li><strong>The Birth of Za Warudo (The World)</strong></li>
            <p id="za-warudo-text">With Jonathan Joestar's body as his own, Dio Brando ended up in Cairo, Egypt where he enlisted the servitude of Enya. She was an old hag who had in her possession an ancient bow and arrow. Similar to the stone mask, the arrow had a hidden power. Those who were pierced by its point and survived, gained a special ability to manifest the strength of their mental fortitude as well as their fighting spirit. Now known as only Dio, he ordered Enya to pierce him with the arrow and unlock his special stand from within him. This fearsome stand would from then on be known as "The World".</p>
            <li><strong>The Re-Building of his Army</strong></li>
            <p id="dio-army-text">While he spent his time in Cairo, Dio charmed many people into becoming his minions. He then sent out these recruits to do his bidding. These tasks included fighting off the oncoming Joestar descendants as well as gathering more people with the potential to foster powerful stands (though none were nearly as powerful as "The World"). If Dio was unsuccessful in charming a potential servant, he would resort to infusing them with cells of his own flesh to control them from afar. The most powerful of his servants were known as the "Agents of Dio".</p>
            <li><strong>The Undoing of DIO</strong></li>
            <p id="dio-undoing-text">Dio continued to ignore the descendant's of his past rival, Jonathan Joestar, until they arrived inside his mansion located in Egypt. He proceeded to send the guards in an attempt to finish off the invaders, which ultimately failed. Dio took it upon himself to finish off the persistant attackers, he revealed himself to them. Once they realized how strong Dio was, the descendants fled into the city. Dio pursued them and in the end lost in a stand face off with his "The World" versus Jotaro Kujo's (Jonathan Joestar's great-great grandson) "Star Platinum". Dio not only lost Joestar's body but was also exposed to sunlight, his one greatest weakness besides hamon. There was nothing left of Dio afterwards.</p>
